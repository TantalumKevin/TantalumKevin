- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TantalumKevin
- ðŸ‘€ I like embedded and server-side and client-side development. At present, I only have a rough knowledge of C / C + + and python, and have a little knowledge of computer vision and neural networks. (strictly speaking, other programming languages, such as markdown or HTML, are not included in this column, although I know both of them.)
- ðŸŒ± I am now learning to develop STM32 MCU program; I plan to study Free RTOS, C#, Java, android application development in the future.
- ðŸ“« If you need anything, please contact me via Email: tantalum_zhao@qq.com.
